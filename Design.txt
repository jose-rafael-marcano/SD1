System API 

Assuming no images/ or attachment, only text.

Response create(api-key,userId,text )
Response is json with {"id:UUID",
                       "url":"www.hostame/userId/6unikey",
					   "date":"UTC date of creation",
					   "expirationTime":"UTC datetime"}
					   

Response get(api-key,userId,url)
Response is json with {"id:UUID",
                        "text":" ....... ",
						 "expirationTime":"UTC datetime"}


						

Response delete(api-key,userId,userId,url)
Response is json with {"id:UUID",
                        "status":"success"/"failure"/"documentNotFound"}
						
						
Calculations:

my system will be read heavy:
so ratio is 100:1
I am assuming 1 million of new url per day. so this mean 1 000,000 x 100 reads per day= 100,000, 000 of reads per day.
QPS for write 1 000 0000 /86400 ~ 12 QPS 

For read will be 12 x 100 ~ 1200 QPS for read. 


i am assuming the text to be store will be max 5 mb but average will be 100k. so this text plus 1000 bytes of metadata.
so in average we will multiply 101k x 1,000,000 -> 101 000 000 kb -> ~ 102 gb per per day. then x 30 ~ 3060 GB per month 3.1 TB. 

 3.1 TB x 12 ~ 36 TB per year.
if we want to get extra space we can buy 40 tb per year to mantain more than 20% free. then we will have 44 TB per year.  

44 tb x 10 years will be 440 tb in ten years
